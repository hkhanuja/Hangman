# Hangman

## What is Hangman?

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to uncover a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.  
Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn on a gallows.  
The game concludes when the player either successfully guesses the word or the stick figure is fully drawn, indicating too many incorrect guesses.
