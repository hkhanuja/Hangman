# Hangman

## ðŸ“Œ What is Hangman?

**Hangman** is a classic word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.  
Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn.  
The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or the figure is fully drawn (indicating too many incorrect guesses).
